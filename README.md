Authors: Mohammad Mahdi Ahmadian, Alexander Paz

This is an implementation of the Multi-Objective Global-Best Harmony Search (MOGBHS) algorithm for calibrating microscopic traffic-
flow simulation models. The details of MOGBHS can be found in the follwoing paper:

MOGBHS is interfaced with the Aimsun simulator via the API (Application Programming Interface) that
allows reading of calibration parameters at each step of algorithm.
